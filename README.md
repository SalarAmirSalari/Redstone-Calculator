# Creating a 4 bit calculator in Minecraft:
### requirements : Minecraft + Logic gates+ shematics based on logic gates
you can find how to make [logic gates](https://www.minecraft101.net/redstone/redstone-logic.html) in minecraft.
After doing that you can build any projects based on logic gates

Nothing as Carry in 
Lamps as LED's
